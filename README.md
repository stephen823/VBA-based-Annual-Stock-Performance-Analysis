# VBA-challenge
This project involves an analysis of the stock market. The key objective is to analyze the yearly performance of stock from 2014 to 2016. Additionally, finding the best performing, worst performing and most traded stock is also a goal of the project. Both objectives are achieved through calculation of the yearly change in real and percentage terms and finding stocks with the most noticeable performance and traded volume.
